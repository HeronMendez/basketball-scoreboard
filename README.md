## Basketball Scoreboard

Introduction
This project is part of a series of JavaScript practice exercises that Iâ€™m completing as part of the "Learn Javascript" course on Scrimba (https://v2.scrimba.com/) . The goal of this exercise is to get familiar with creating basic functions and using arithmetic operations in JavaScript.

Description
Basketball Scoreboard is a simple application that lets you keep track of the score in a basketball game. The interface includes two sections, one for the home team and one for the guest team, each with its respective scoreboard. Each side has three buttons that allow you to add +1, +2, or +3 points, reflecting the different ways to score in a basketball game. This practice is a straightforward and effective way to apply basic JavaScript concepts in a functional project.
